3. [ Titanic Project ] ðŸš¢ðŸŽ«
In my Titanic project, my task was to conduct an analysis to understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers during the ship's disaster. I analyzed variables such as gender, passenger class, ticket fare, and family size. I cleaned the data and created a predictive model that accurately forecasts outcomes based on historical data. I also created visualizations such as dashboards with key survival metrics. My analysis includes key insights and trends regarding the survivors of the Titanic.
